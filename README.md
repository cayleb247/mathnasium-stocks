# Mathnasium Stocks

### Background

I work part time at a local Mathnasium learning center and wanted to create a way for students to learn some real-world investment skills that involved Mathnasium's own currency system. Using Mathnasium Stocks, instructors can make their own stocks that mirror real world market data. For example - Disney's market data is converted into Mathnasium cards using a simple conversion and is then listed on the platform for instructors to display to students.
